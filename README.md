# NMDownloader
A python tool to download mod files from https://www.nexusmods.com/. In a very unfinished state.

Showcases use of requests package to interact with a NexusMods API.

Due to the authentication issues NexusMods have with automatic download of files from their site, it is currently impossible to implement automatic updates and downloads without having a prior agreement with the owners of the site.
